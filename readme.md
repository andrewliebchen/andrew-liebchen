# FAQ

### What the heck is this?

Its the personal site for me, Andrew Liebchen. I'm a UI designer in Boston/Cambridge, MA.  Currently, I'm the lead designer at [OpenGov](http://www.opengov.com).

### You're a designer?  Where can I find examples of your work?

Well, the little landing page has links to my five most recent shots on [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/andrewliebchen). A more complete online portfolio is forthcoming.

### I've looked at this repo, and its a mess.

That's not really a question.  But yes, I usually like to be a little cleaner, a little DRY-er with my production code.  This site is a work-in-progress, and kind of cobbled together on the fly.  Cut me some slack...you're really not helping my chronic case of imposter's syndrome.

### Sorry.

Don't worry about it, really.

### Is "Liebchen" really German for "sweetheart"?

It's true, look it up.
